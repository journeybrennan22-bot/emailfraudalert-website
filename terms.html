    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 9, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to Email Fraud Alert. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Email Fraud Alert browser extension, Outlook add-in, and related services (the "Service") operated by Baynac LLC ("we," "our," or "us").</p>

    <p>By using our Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Email Fraud Alert is a fraud detection tool that analyzes email metadata to identify potential wire fraud, phishing, and email impersonation attempts. The Service provides warnings and alerts to help you identify suspicious emails.</p>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Email Fraud Alert is an aid to help detect potential fraud. It is NOT a guarantee against fraud. You are solely responsible for verifying all wire transfer instructions, payment requests, and sender identities through independent means (such as calling known phone numbers) before taking any action.
    </div>

    <h2>2. No Guarantee Against Fraud</h2>
    <p>While our Service is designed to detect common fraud patterns, we cannot and do not guarantee that:</p>

        <li>All warnings indicate actual fraud</li>
        <li>You will not experience financial loss from fraud</li>
        <li>The Service will be error-free or uninterrupted</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You acknowledge that sophisticated fraud attempts may evade detection, and you remain responsible for exercising caution with all financial transactions.</p>

    <p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.</p>
    <p><strong>Free Trial:</strong> If offered, free trials convert to paid subscriptions unless cancelled before the trial ends.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>

    <p>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
