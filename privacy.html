    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>Email Fraud Alert ("we," "our," or "us") is operated by Baynac LLC. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our browser extension and Outlook add-in (the "Service").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Email Metadata:</strong> Our Service analyzes email metadata (sender address, display name, reply-to address, domain information) to detect potential fraud. This analysis occurs locally on your device or within your email client.</p>
    <p><strong>Domain Reputation Checks:</strong> When analyzing an email, our Service may send the sender's domain name (e.g., "example.com") to our secure domain reputation service to check against known threat databases and verify domain registration age. Only the domain name is transmitted. No email content, subject lines, recipient information, or personal data is sent during this check.</p>
    <p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> With your permission, the Service accesses your contacts (Google Contacts for Gmail, Outlook Contacts for Microsoft 365) to compare against incoming emails for lookalike detection. This data is processed locally and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you subscribe to our paid service, we collect your email address and payment information through our payment processor (Stripe). We do not store your full credit card details.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The content or body of your emails</li>
        <li>Email subject lines</li>
        <li>Attachments</li>
        <li>Recipient names or addresses</li>
        <li>Your contact lists (these are only accessed locally)</li>
        <li>Browsing history</li>
        <li>Personal files</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use information solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect and warn you about potential email fraud</li>
        <li>Check sender domains against known threat intelligence databases</li>
        <li>Verify domain registration age to identify newly created fraudulent domains</li>
        <li>Process your subscription payments</li>
        <li>Provide customer support</li>
        <li>Improve our fraud detection capabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Processing Location</h2>
    <p>Most email analysis and fraud detection occurs locally on your device or within your email client's environment. The only data transmitted externally is the sender's domain name, which is sent over an encrypted (HTTPS) connection to our domain reputation service hosted on Cloudflare to check against threat intelligence databases and verify domain age. No email content is ever sent to external servers.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> For domain reputation lookups and threat intelligence. Only sender domain names are transmitted. See <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> For payment processing. See <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google APIs:</strong> For Gmail extension contact access. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Graph API:</strong> For Outlook add-in contact access. See <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/">Microsoft's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect any information we do collect. Email analysis occurs locally, and the only external communication is domain name lookups transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. Your email content never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain account and payment information for as long as your subscription is active and as required by law. We do not retain any email content or metadata after analysis is complete. Domain reputation lookup results may be cached temporarily to improve performance but are not associated with any user or email.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access information we hold about you</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your account</li>
        <li>Opt out of marketing communications</li>
        <li>Revoke permissions granted to the extension/add-in at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the new policy on our website with an updated date.</p>
