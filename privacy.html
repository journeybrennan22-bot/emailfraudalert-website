    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 9, 2025</p>

    <p>Email Fraud Alert ("we," "our," or "us") is operated by Baynac LLC. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our browser extension and Outlook add-in (the "Service").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Email Metadata:</strong> Our Service analyzes email metadata (sender address, display name, reply-to address, domain information) to detect potential fraud. This analysis occurs locally on your device or within your email client.</p>
    <p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> With your permission, the Service accesses your contacts (Google Contacts for Gmail, Outlook Contacts for Microsoft 365) to compare against incoming emails for lookalike detection. This data is processed locally and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you subscribe to our paid service, we collect your email address and payment information through our payment processor (Stripe). We do not store your full credit card details.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The content or body of your emails</li>
        <li>Attachments</li>
        <li>Your contact lists (these are only accessed locally)</li>
        <li>Browsing history</li>
        <li>Personal files</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use information solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect and warn you about potential email fraud</li>
        <li>Process your subscription payments</li>
        <li>Provide customer support</li>
        <li>Improve our fraud detection capabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Processing Location</h2>
    <p>All email analysis and fraud detection occurs locally on your device or within your email client's environment. Your email data is not sent to external servers for processing.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> For payment processing. See <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google APIs:</strong> For Gmail extension contact access. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Graph API:</strong> For Outlook add-in contact access. See <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/">Microsoft's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect any information we do collect. Since email analysis occurs locally, your sensitive email data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain account and payment information for as long as your subscription is active and as required by law. We do not retain any email content or metadata after analysis is complete.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access information we hold about you</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your account</li>
        <li>Opt out of marketing communications</li>
        <li>Revoke permissions granted to the extension/add-in at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the new policy on our website with an updated date.</p>
